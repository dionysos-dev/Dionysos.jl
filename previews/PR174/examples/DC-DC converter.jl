# We consider a boost DC-DC converter which has been widely studied from the point of view of hybrid control, see for example in  [1, V.A],[2],[3].
# This is a **safety problem** for a **switching system**.
#
# ![Boost DC-DC converter.](https://github.com/dionysos-dev/Dionysos.jl/blob/master/docs/assets/dcdcboost.jpg?raw=true)
#
# The state of the system is given by $x(t) = \begin{bmatrix} i_l(t) & v_c(t) \end{bmatrix}^\top$.
# The switching system has two modes consisting in two-dimensional affine dynamics:
# ```math
# \dot{x} = f_p(x) = A_p x + b_p,\quad p=1,2
# ```
# with
# ```math
# A_1 = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{r_l}{x_l} &0 \\ 0 & -\frac{1}{x_c}\frac{1}{r_0+r_c}  \end{bmatrix}, A_2= \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{x_l}\left(r_l+\frac{r_0r_c}{r_0+r_c}\right) & -\frac{1}{x_l}\frac{r_0}{r_0+r_c}  \\ \frac{1}{x_c}\frac{r_0}{r_0+r_c}   & -\frac{1}{x_c}\frac{1}{r_0+r_c}  \end{bmatrix}, b = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{v_s}{x_l}\\0\end{bmatrix}.
# ```
# The goal is to design a controller to keep the state of the system in a safety region around the reference desired value, using as input only the switching
# signal.
#
#
# In order to study the concrete system and its symbolic abstraction in a unified framework, we will solve the problem
# for the sampled system with a sampling time $\tau$.
#
# The abstraction is based on a feedback refinment relation [4,V.2 Definition].
# Basically, this is equivalent to an alternating simulation relationship with the additional constraint that the input of the
# concrete and symbolic system preserving the relation must be identical.
# This allows to easily determine the controller of the concrete system from the abstraction controller by simply adding a quantization step.
#
# For the construction of the relations in the abstraction, it is necessary to over-approximate attainable sets of
# a particular cell. In this example, we consider the used of a growth bound function  [4, VIII.2, VIII.5] which is one of the possible methods to over-approximate
# attainable sets of a particular cell based on the state reach by its center. Therefore, it is used
# to compute the relations in the abstraction based on the feedback refinement relation.
#

# First, let us import [StaticArrays](https://github.com/JuliaArrays/StaticArrays.jl).

using StaticArrays

# At this point, we import the useful Dionysos sub-module for this problem: [Abstraction](@__REPO_ROOT_URL__/src/Abstraction/abstraction.jl).
using Dionysos
const DI = Dionysos
const UT = DI.Utils
const DO = DI.Domain
const ST = DI.System
const CO = DI.Control
const SY = DI.Symbolic

# ### Definition of the system
# we can import the module containing the DCDC problem like this 
include(joinpath(dirname(dirname(pathof(Dionysos))), "problems", "DCDC.jl"))

# and we can instantiate the DC system with the provided system
contsys=DCDC.system()

#The default values are included, but can be changed. 
DCDC.solveproblem(contsys) 

# ### Trajectory display
# We choose the number of steps `nsteps` for the sampled system, i.e. the total elapsed time: `nstep`*`tstep`
# as well as the true initial state `x0` which is contained in the initial state-space defined previously.
#nstep = 300;
#x0 = SVector(1.2, 5.6);
# To complete
