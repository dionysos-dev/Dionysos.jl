## Overview
Dionysos is the software of the ERC project Learning to control (L2C). In view of the Cyber-Physical Revolution, the only sensible way of controlling these complex systems is often by discretizing the different variables, thus transforming the model into a simple combinatorial problem on a finite-state automaton, called an abstraction of this system. The goal of L2C is to transform this approach into an effective, scalable, cutting-edge technology that will address the CPS challenges and unlock their potential. This ambitious goal will be achieved by leveraging powerful tools from Mathematical Engineering.

## Current version
The current version is still in the making, and allows to solve problems such as reachability problems for hybrid systems. See the [Docs](https://dionysos-dev.github.io/Dionysos.jl/dev/)Â for further information.

## Longterm objectives
Rather than relying on closed-form analysis of a model of the dynamical system, Dionysos will learn the optimal control from data, whether harvested from the physical system or generated synthetically. It will rely on a novel methodology, combining the efficiency of several modern optimization/control-theoretic/machine-learning techniques with the theoretical power of the Abstraction approach. All the pieces of the architecture are chosen to foster black-box and data-driven analysis, thereby matching rising and unresolved challenges. Summarizing, the objectives are
* To develop a mathematical and algorithmic framework for efficient Abstraction of Cyber-Physical Systems thriving on recent technologies in Optimization and Control;
* To leverage this framework in situations where the system is described by data, rather than a classical model;
