    Basic generic RRT algorihtm
    SI : initial state (this will be the root of the tree) ;
    SF : target state that we try to reach ;
    distance : function that defines a metric between the states ;
    rand_state : function that returns a random candidate state ;
    new_conf : function that returns a reachable state, with the action and the cost ;
    keep : function to filter the node that we want to add during an iteration;
    stop_crit : stop criteria ;
    RRTstar : boolean to use RRT* ;
    compute_transition : to compute transition between to given state (if RRTstar is true).
