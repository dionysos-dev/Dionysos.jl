This is a <strong>safety problem</strong> for a <strong>switching system</strong>.</p><p><img src="https://github.com/dionysos-dev/Dionysos.jl/blob/master/docs/assets/dcdcboost.jpg?raw=true" alt="Boost DC-DC converter."/></p><p>The state of the system is given by <span>$x(t) = \begin{bmatrix} i_l(t) &amp; v_c(t) \end{bmatrix}^\top$</span>. The switching system has two modes consisting in two-dimensional affine dynamics:</p><p class="math-container">\[\dot{x} = f_p(x) = A_p x + b_p,\quad p=1,2\]</p><p>with</p><p class="math-container">\[A_1 = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{r_l}{x_l} &amp;0 \\ 0 &amp; -\frac{1}{x_c}\frac{1}{r_0+r_c}  \end{bmatrix}, A_2= \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{x_l}\left(r_l+\frac{r_0r_c}{r_0+r_c}\right) &amp; -\frac{1}{x_l}\frac{r_0}{r_0+r_c}  \\ \frac{1}{x_c}\frac{r_0}{r_0+r_c}   &amp; -\frac{1}{x_c}\frac{1}{r_0+r_c}  \end{bmatrix}, b = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{v_s}{x_l}\\0\end{bmatrix}.\]</p><p>The goal is to design a controller to keep the state of the system in a safety region around the reference desired value, using as input only the switching signal.</p><p>In order to study the concrete system and its symbolic abstraction in a unified framework, we will solve the problem for the sampled system with a sampling time <span>$\tau$</span>.</p><p>The abstraction is based on a feedback refinment relation [4,V.2 Definition]. Basically, this is equivalent to an alternating simulation relationship with the additional constraint that the input of the concrete and symbolic system preserving the relation must be identical. This allows to easily determine the controller of the concrete system from the abstraction controller by simply adding a quantization step.</p><p>For the construction of the relations in the abstraction, it is necessary to over-approximate attainable sets of a particular cell. In this example, we consider the used of a growth bound function  [4, VIII.2, VIII.5] which is one of the possible methods to over-approximate attainable sets of a particular cell based on the state reach by its center. Therefore, it is used to compute the relations in the abstraction based on the feedback refinement relation.</p><p>First, let us import <a href="https://github.com/JuliaArrays/StaticArrays.jl">StaticArrays</a> and [Plots].</p><pre><code class="language-julia hljs">using StaticArrays, Plots</code></pre><p>At this point, we import the useful Dionysos sub-modules.</p><pre><code class="language-julia hljs">using Dionysos
