Consider a system <span>$\mathcal{S}:=(\mathcal{X}, \mathcal{U},\rightarrow_F)$</span> with the transition function</p><p class="math-container">\[\begin{equation}
    \{A_{\psi(x)}x+B_{\psi(x)}u+g_{\psi(x)}\}\oplus\Omega_{\psi(x)}
\end{equation}\]</p><p>where <span>$\psi:\mathcal{X}\rightarrow\{1,\dots,N_p\}$</span> selects one of the <span>$N_p$</span> subsystems defined by the matrices</p><p class="math-container">\[\begin{equation}
	A_1=\begin{bmatrix}
    1.01 &amp; 0.3\\
    -0.1 &amp; 1.01
\end{bmatrix}, ~B_1=\begin{bmatrix}
    1&amp;0\\ 0 &amp; 1
\end{bmatrix},~g_1=\begin{bmatrix}
-0.1\\-0.1

\end{equation}\]</p><p class="math-container">\[A_2=A_1^\top,~ A_3=A_1,~B_2=B_3=B_1,~g_2=0\]</p><p>and <span>$g_3=-g_1$</span>. These systems are three spiral sources with unstable equilibria at <span>$x_{e1}=[-0.9635~~0.3654]^\top,~x_{e2}=0,$</span> and <span>$x_{e3}=-x_{e1}$</span>. We also define the additive-noise sets <span>$\Omega_1=\Omega_2=\Omega_3=[-0.05,0.05]^2$</span>, the control-input set <span>$\mathcal{U}=[-0.5,0.5]^2$</span> and the state space <span>$\mathcal{X}=[-2,2]^2$</span>. The <span>$N_p=3$</span> partitions of <span>$\mathcal{X}$</span> are <span>$\mathcal{X}_1= \{x\in\mathcal{X}~:~x_1\leq-1 \},~\mathcal{X}_3= \{x\in\mathcal{X}~:~x_1&gt;1 \},$</span> and <span>$\mathcal{X}_2=\mathcal{X}\setminus(\mathcal{X}_1\cup\mathcal{X}_3)$</span>. The goal is to bring the state <span>$x$</span> from the initial set <span>$\mathcal{X}_0$</span> to a final set <span>$\mathcal{X}_*$</span>, while avoiding the obstacle <span>$\mathcal{O}$</span>, which are to be defined.</p><p>First, let us import <a href="https://github.com/JuliaArrays/StaticArrays.jl">StaticArrays</a>, <a href="https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/LinearAlgebra/">LinearAlgebra</a>, <a href="https://github.com/JuliaPolyhedra/CDDLib.jl">CDDLib</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jump-dev/SDPA.jl">SDPA</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jump-dev/Ipopt.jl">Ipopt</a>, and <a href="https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/stable/">JuMP</a>.

We assume that inside cells intersecting the boundary of partitions of <span>$\mathcal{X}$</span> the selected piecewise-affine mode is the same all over its interior and given by the mode defined at its center.
